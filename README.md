Contains a collection of projects and code that I have worked on. These include a Markov chain stepping model I developed to understand what drives stepping patterns observed in human subject running experiments on custom-designed uneven terrain, a large ensemble Monte Carlo simulation I developed to explore the dynamics of running on uneven terrain using a simple, mathematical model, and most recently, analysis I performed using a large set of ant trajectory data to characterize the dynamics of ant trail formation.
